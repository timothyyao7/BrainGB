<!-- # BrainGB

BrainGB is a python package for testing Graph Neural Networks on Brain Networks.  -->
# Library Highlights
Our BrainGB implements four main modules of GNN models for brain network analysis:
* **Node feature construction**: studies practical and effective methods to initialize either positional or structural node features for each brain region.
* **Message passing mechanisms**: update the node representation of each brain region iteratively by aggregating neighbor features through local connections.
* **Attention-enhanced message passing**: incorporates attention mechanism to enhance the message passing scheme of GNNs. 
* **Pooling strategies**: operate on the set of node vectors to get a graph-level representation.

BrainGB also implements utility functions for model training, performance evaluation, and experiment management.

# Using BrainGB
There are two ways to use BrainGB: the first is running direct experiments with BrainGB, and the second is integrating BrainGB into your existing research projects. Follow the sections below to learn more.

## Direct Experiments with BrainGB

### 1. Obtaining Datasets

#### **ABIDE Dataset**
We understand the challenges faced by researchers in accessing certain datasets due to restrictions. To facilitate your experimentation with BrainGB, we provide the [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html), which is publicly accessible and does not require special access permissions. 

- [Download and Preprocess ABIDE dataset here](https://github.com/HennyJie/BrainGB/tree/master/examples/utils/get_abide)


#### **Datasets Requiring Access**
For a detailed exploration of other datasets like **PNC**, **PPMI**, and **ABCD** utilized in our BrainGB studies, which are not publicly accessible and require specific access permissions, please refer to the following:

- [Other Datasets and Decription](https://braingb.us/datasets/)

- [Preprocessing Steps and Protocols](https://braingb.us/preprocessing/)


You can also construct your own datasets by following the instructions on neuroimaging preprocessing and functional or structural brain network construction on our [website](https://braingb.us/preprocessing/).

### 2. Quick Setup

Clone the repository and Install required dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HennyJie/BrainGB.git
```
Navigate to the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
BrainGB depends on the following packages:
```
torch~=1.10.2
numpy~=1.22.2
nni~=2.4
PyYAML~=5.4.1
scikit-learn~=1.0.2
networkx~=2.6.2
scipy~=1.7.3
tensorly~=0.6.0
pandas~=1.4.1
libsvm~=3.23.0.4
matplotlib~=3.4.3
tqdm~=4.62.3
torch-geometric~=2.0.3
h5py~=3.6.0
```

---

### 3. Running Example
Use the ABIDE dataset as an example, you should first place the dataset file "abide.npy" (genereated from [step 1](#1-obtaining-datasets)) in the `datasets` folder under the `examples` folder (Create the folder if it does not exist). The `abide.npy` file contains the following contents:

- **timeseries**: Represents the BOLD time series data for each subject. It's a numpy array with the shape (#sub, #ROI, #timesteps).
  
- > **Label**: Provides the diagnosis label for Autism spectrum disorder for each subject. '0' denotes negative, and '1' indicates positive. It's a numpy array of shape (#sub).
  
- > **corr**: The correlation matrix calculated from BOLD time series data. It's a numpy array with the shape (#sub, #ROIs, #ROIs).
  
- **pcorr**: Represents the partial correlation matrix derived from the BOLD time series data. It's a numpy array with dimensions (#sub, #ROIs, #ROIs).
  
- **site**: Specifies where the data was collected for each subject. It's a numpy array with shape (#sub).

**`Important Note`**: `"Label"` and `"corr matrix"` are the actual *inputs* for BrainGB. `Label` represents the target outcome we are interested in predicting, often indicating the diagnosis or condition of a subject in a brain study. `corr matrix` describes the associated Brain Network. If you are considering running BrainGB using your own dataset, it's important to format your Label and corr matrix similarly to ensure compatibility and accurate results. Ensure that `Label` is in a *numpy array* of shape **(#sub)** and `corr matrix` is structured as a *numpy array* with the shape **(#sub, #ROIs, #ROIs)**.<br><br>



#### **Run the BrainGB code, execute the following command**:
```shell
python -m main.example_main --dataset_name ABIDE --pooling concat --gcn_mp_type edge_node_concate --hidden_dim 256
```
The parameter `pooling` specifies the pooling strategy to get a graph-level representation for each subject and `gcn_mp_type` sets a message vector design for the `gcn` model. If you choose `gat` as the backbone model, you can use `gat_mp_type` to set an attention-enhancing mechanism.

For other hyper-parameters like `--n_GNN_layer`, `--n_MLP_layers`, `--hidden_dim`, `--epochs`, etc., you can modify them to adjust the detailed model design or control the training process. If you'd like to automatically search and optimize these hyper-parameters, use the AutoML tool NNI with the `--enable_nni` command.

Upon successful execution, you should observe an output similar to this:

```plaintext
Processing...
Done!

### 4. Customizing Your Own GNN Models
#### Node Feature Construction
In `src.dataset.tranforms`, BrainGB provides the `BaseTransform` base class, which offers a universal interface for node feature initialization for each brain region. Specifically, BrainGB implements the following node feature construction functions: 

| Node Features                            | Option Name        |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Identity                        | `identity`      |
| Eigen                      | `eigenvector`    |
| Degree                   | `degree`  |
| Degree Profile                    | `LDP`  |
| Connection Profile           | `adj` |

To adjust the type of node features, simply set the chosen option name for the input parameter `node_features`.

#### Message Passing Mechanisms
In `models.gcn`, BrainGB provides the base class `MPGCNConv` and different message vector designs including: 
| Message Passing Mechanisms                    | Option Name          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Edge Weighted | `weighted_sum`  |
| Bin Concat        | `bin_concate` |
| Edge Weight Concat | `edge_weight_concate`  |
| Node Edge Concat        | `edge_node_concate` |
| Node Concat        | `node_concate` |

To adjust the message passing schemes, simply set the input parameter `model_name` as `gcn` and chose an option name for the parameter `gcn_mp_type`.

#### Attention-Enhanced Message Passing
In `models.gat`, BrainGB provides the base class `MPGATConv` and different versions of attention-enhanced message passing designs including:
| Message Passing Mechanisms                    | Option Name          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Attention Weighted | `attention_weighted`  |
| Edge Weighted w/ Attn        | `attention_edge_weighted` |
| Attention Edge Sum | `sum_attention_edge`  |
| Node Edge Concat w/ Attn        | `edge_node_concate` |
| Node Concat w/ Attn        | `node_concate` |

Note that some of these options are corresponding attention enhanced version of the message passing mechanism designs. Please refer to our paper for more details.

To adjust the attention-enhanced message passing schemes, simply set the input parameter `model_name` as `gat` and chose an option name for the parameter `gat_mp_type`.

#### Pooling Strategies
The pooling strategy is controlled by setting the `self.pooling` in the chosen model. Specifically, BrainGB implements the following three basic pooling strategies: 
| Pooling Strategies                    | Option Name          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Mean Pooling | `mean`  |
| Sum Pooling        | `sum` |
| Concat Pooling | `concat`  |

To adjust the pooling strategies, simply set the chosen option name for the input parameter `pooling`.

## Integrating BrainGB into Your Workflow

### 1. Install BrainGB as a package


To integrate BrainGB into your research projects and leverage its capabilities, install the package via your package manager:

```shell
pip install BrainGB
```
Notice that if you install the package through pip, the dependencies are automatically installed.

### 2. Incorporating BrainGB Models

BrainGB provides modular components, making it easier to integrate with various projects. Import the necessary modules and initialize the models according to your research needs.

```python
from BrainGB.models import GAT, GCN, BrainNN
```
The BrainNN is required and will be served as the parent module of the GAT, GCN models. You may choose either GAT or GCN as the submodule.

#### Model Initialization:  
For a GCN-based setup:
```python
sample: Data = Data()  # A torch geometric data
num_features = data.x.shape[1]
num_nodes = data.x.shape[0]
gcn_model = GCN(num_features, num_nodes)
model = BrainNN(args.pooling, gcn_model, MLP(2 * num_nodes))
```
For a GAT-based setup, simply replace the GCN model initializations with GAT. Both models are customizable. Please refer to the [Customizing Your Own GNN Models](#4-customizing-your-own-gnn-models) section for more details.
