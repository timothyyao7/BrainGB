This is the repository for my work done on investigating GNNs on the ABCD rs-fMRI dataset.

It is forked from the BrainGB repository, and we use the training/evaluation found in examples\example_main.py.

See the batch script in the root directory for the commands used to train the models.

Please see the visualization jupyter notebook in the root directory to obtain the plots in the presentation.

See the results folder for the final results obtained in the presentation.
